# DIY Guide: Fixing Air Conditioner Water Leaks  
## Top Reason: Clogged Pipe  

### Overview  
This guide explains how to fix air conditioner water leaks in just 10 minutes with minimal tools. It focuses specifically on the most common cause: a clogged drainage pipe. At the end, you’ll also find a summary of other potential issues with solutions and links.

### Tools Needed  
- **Phillips screwdriver**  
- **Thick straw or narrow tube** (to blow water into the pipe and clear the clog)

### Steps  

#### 1. **Understand the Basics**  
Before starting, familiarize yourself with the water drainage system in your air conditioner.  
- Watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNgymBMYLtM) to understand where water collects and how leaks can occur.  

#### 2. **Turn Off the Electricity**  
- Ensure the power is completely off to avoid safety risks.  

#### 3. **Disassemble the Case**  
- Refer to your unit’s specific disassembly guide (often found on YouTube or in manuals).  
- **General tip:** Most cases are removed by pushing them upward, but the machine itself follows the same logic. Fix the machine first and only lift the case to avoid accidentally dislodging the machine.  

#### 4. **Check if This Fix Applies**  
- **Signs you have a clogged pipe issue:**  
  - Water is pooling in the drain pan and leaking instead of draining properly.  
  - Locate the drain hole:  
    - Typically, there are two drain holes (left and right), but only one is functional. The other is usually sealed—ignore the sealed one.  
    - Use a flashlight to inspect the functional drain hole for clogs or debris (e.g., soft dirt or foreign objects).  
- If the drain hole isn’t clogged but you want to clean it as part of routine maintenance, continue to the next step.  

#### 5. **Clear the Drain Pipe**  
- **Remove debris:**  
  - Use tweezers or a similar tool to extract visible dirt. Be gentle—do not use excessive force as you might damage the pipe.  
  - If debris is difficult to remove manually, proceed to blow it out.  
- **Blow out the clog:**  
  - If you can access the pipe’s end, blow into it to push the debris out.  
  - Alternatively, use water to flush the pipe from the front side. Insert water into the pipe using a thick straw or similar tool.  
    - **Tip:** Water is more effective than air for clearing stubborn debris and avoids creating bubbles that could spread a mess.

### Other Common Issues  
If the above steps don’t solve the problem, consider these alternatives:  

1. **Dirty fins (evaporator coil):**  
   - Dust buildup or bent fins can prevent water from reaching the drain pan, causing leaks outside it.  
   - This issue can be identified if the plate isn’t full of water, but water is leaking elsewhere in the unit.  

2. **Leaking pipe:**  
   - Older pipes may crack or develop leaks due to aging plastic or loose connections to the machine.  
   - To identify the issue, pour water into the plate and observe where it leaks.  
   - Depending on the case, you can use tape or glue to temporarily fix the leak.  

3. **Improperly tilted drain pan:**  
   - If the drain pan isn’t angled correctly, water won’t flow to the drain hole.  
   - This is easy to identify if water pools near the sealed (unused) hole instead of draining out.
